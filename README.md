# HallEffectEncoder
Hall-Effect Angular Encoder

The project is designed to encode angular position of a diametrically magnetized disc 
by using hall-effect sensors. Hall-effect principle is used to determine angular 
position of the disc. Magnetic field of the disc is detected by two hall-effect sensors. 
According to these sensorsâ€™ output and the known angles of the magnetic disc, a 
proper look-up table is determined. Look-up calibrated system is used to provide 
required accuracy of the project. Arduino Uno is used as a processor which is used 
for analog-to-digital conversion and controlling the stepper motor.
